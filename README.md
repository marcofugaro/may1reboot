# May 1st Reboot WebGL Globe

This project contains the WebGL globe that runs in the header of the [May 1st Reboot showcase](http://www.may1reboot.com/). It uses [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/) for rendering and [GSAP](http://greensock.com/gsap) for animations. The globe is interactive and works on mobile as well as desktop.

## Get up and running

Just run `npm run start-old-node`, it will use an old version of node to install and compile the project
